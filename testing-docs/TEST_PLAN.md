# WaterSafe Test Plan

## Test Objectives

This test plan ensures the WaterSafe application meets quality standards and provides reliable functionality for protecting families from water contamination risks, with special focus on pregnant women and infants.

## Test Scope

### In Scope
- **Frontend Application**: Vue.js 3 application with all major features
- **Maternal & Infant Health Shield**: Core functionality including hydration, feeding, symptom checking, sanitation support, and emergency tips
- **Navigation & User Experience**: Navigation between features, responsive design, accessibility
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage functionality for offline capabilities
- **API Integration**: Backend communication for water quality predictions and data
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Modern browser support

### Out of Scope
- **Backend API Testing**: Separate test plan required for FastAPI backend
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing and stress testing (separate plan)
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and security audits (separate plan)
- **Third-party Services**: Google Maps API, external data sources

## Test Strategy
